This web app uses a machine learning model to predict the risk of diabetes based on patient data. The model has been trained on a dataset from Kaggle and can provide predictions about diabetes risk for different patients.

##

The model uses a custom Neural Network Pytorch model to make predictions. The model training features include pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more.
